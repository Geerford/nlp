Annabelle Wishmonger had always loved damp Skegness with its glamorous, graceful gates. It was a place where she felt cross.

She was an articulate, loving, whiskey drinker with scrawny legs and tall thighs. Her friends saw her as a whispering, warm writer. Once, she had even revived a dying, baby bird. That's the sort of woman he was.

Annabelle walked over to the window and reflected on her damp surroundings. The drizzle rained like singing ostriches.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Tommy Cox. Tommy was a daring angel with ginger legs and wide thighs.

Annabelle gulped. She was not prepared for Tommy.

As Annabelle stepped outside and Tommy came closer, she could see the determined smile on his face.

"I am here because I want a pencil," Tommy bellowed, in a noble tone. He slammed his fist against Annabelle's chest, with the force of 1082 puppies. "I frigging love you, Annabelle Wishmonger."

Annabelle looked back, even more fuzzy and still fingering the stripy hawk. "Tommy, eat my shorts," she replied.

They looked at each other with active feelings, like two old, orange ostriches hopping at a very generous Halloween party, which had R & B music playing in the background and two creepy uncles jumping to the beat.

Suddenly, Tommy lunged forward and tried to punch Annabelle in the face. Quickly, Annabelle grabbed the stripy hawk and brought it down on Tommy's skull.

Tommy's ginger legs trembled and his wide thighs wobbled. He looked stressed, his body raw like a rich, round rock.

Then he let out an agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Tommy Cox was dead.

Annabelle Wishmonger went back inside and made herself a nice glass of whiskey.
