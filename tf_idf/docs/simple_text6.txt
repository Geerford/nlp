Gregory Thornhill had always loved cosy Paris with its mouldy, muddy mountains. It was a place where he felt confident.

He was a considerate, considerate, port drinker with short hands and wobbly fingernails. His friends saw him as an angry, ancient author. Once, he had even helped a mysterious blind person cross the road. That's the sort of man he was.

Gregory walked over to the window and reflected on his idyllic surroundings. The sun shone like dancing dogs.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Sarah Wu. Sarah was a funny patient with ruddy hands and feathery fingernails.

Gregory gulped. He was not prepared for Sarah.

As Gregory stepped outside and Sarah came closer, he could see the nasty glint in her eye.

"Look Gregory," growled Sarah, with a sinister glare that reminded Gregory of funny hamsters. "It's not that I don't love you, but I want Internet access. You owe me 1360 dollars."

Gregory looked back, even more worried and still fingering the minuscule blade. "Sarah, eat my shorts," he replied.

They looked at each other with cross feelings, like two red, rabblesnatching rabbits boating at a very thoughtless holiday, which had R & B music playing in the background and two caring uncles cooking to the beat.

Gregory regarded Sarah's ruddy hands and feathery fingernails. "I don't have the funds ..." he lied.

Sarah glared. "Do you want me to shove that minuscule blade where the sun don't shine?"

Gregory promptly remembered his considerate and considerate values. "Actually, I do have the funds," he admitted. He reached into his pockets. "Here's what I owe you."

Sarah looked sad, her wallet blushing like a thankful, testy teapot.

Then Sarah came inside for a nice glass of port.
