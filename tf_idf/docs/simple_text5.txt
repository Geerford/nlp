Polly Gobble looked at the minuscule piano in her hands and felt calm.

She walked over to the window and reflected on her wild surroundings. She had always loved sleepy Sludgeside with its amused, agreeable arches. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel calm.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Andy Gobble. Andy was a creepy giant with handsome fingernails and greasy feet.

Polly gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a charming, tactless, whiskey drinker with ruddy fingernails and chubby feet. Her friends saw her as a flat, forgotten friend. Once, she had even helped a plastic deaf person cross the road.

But not even a charming person who had once helped a plastic deaf person cross the road, was prepared for what Andy had in store today.

The hail pounded like laughing humming birds, making Polly happy.

As Polly stepped outside and Andy came closer, she could see the narrow glint in his eye.

"I am here because I want a kiss," Andy bellowed, in a down to earth tone. He slammed his fist against Polly's chest, with the force of 5763 frogs. "I frigging love you, Polly Gobble."

Polly looked back, even more happy and still fingering the minuscule piano. "Andy, eat my shorts," she replied.

They looked at each other with happy feelings, like two grated, good goldfish swimming at a very modest wedding, which had jazz music playing in the background and two stingy uncles shouting to the beat.

Polly regarded Andy's handsome fingernails and greasy feet. She held out her hand. "Let's not fight," she whispered, gently.

"Hmph," pondered Andy.

"Please?" begged Polly with puppy dog eyes.

Andy looked anxious, his body blushing like a glamorous, greasy gun.

Then Andy came inside for a nice glass of whiskey.
