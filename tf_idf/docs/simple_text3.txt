John Parker looked at the tattered kettle in his hands and felt surprised.

He walked over to the window and reflected on his grand surroundings. He had always loved backward Upper Boggington with its fair, faithful fields. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel surprised.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Chad Bishop. Chad was an admirable monster with fluffy eyebrows and greasy arms.

John gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a caring, hungry, whiskey drinker with solid eyebrows and wobbly arms. His friends saw him as a decomposing, damaged deity. Once, he had even helped a bitter baby cross the road.

But not even a caring person who had once helped a bitter baby cross the road, was prepared for what Chad had in store today.

The moon shone like swimming mice, making John delighted.

As John stepped outside and Chad came closer, he could see the tart glint in his eye.

"I am here because I want equality," Chad bellowed, in a hilarious tone. He slammed his fist against John's chest, with the force of 9540 frogs. "I frigging love you, John Parker."

John looked back, even more delighted and still fingering the tattered kettle. "Chad, I don't have the money," he replied.

They looked at each other with fuzzy feelings, like two gentle, giant goldfish eating at a very popular dinner party, which had flute music playing in the background and two thoughtful uncles bouncing to the beat.

John studied Chad's fluffy eyebrows and greasy arms. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry, but I can't give you equality," he explained, in pitying tones.

Chad looked jumpy, his body raw like a giant, green gun.

John could actually hear Chad's body shatter into 6669 pieces. Then the admirable monster hurried away into the distance.

Not even a glass of whiskey would calm John's nerves tonight.
