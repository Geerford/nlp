TOKYO: The dollarNSE -1.15 % was on course for a weekly loss on Friday as the US Federal Reserve's massive new lending programme for small companies and signs of a slowdown in coronavirus infections reduced safe-haven demand.

The pound pulled ahead against the dollar and the euro as markets breathed a sigh of relief after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson left intensive care following his hospitalisation for COVID-19 symptoms.

Currencies from oil-producing countries also held onto gains against the US currency, but the outlook remains uncertain due to doubts that a deal between OPEC and its allies for a record oil supply cut would be enough to offset the collapse in global fuel demand.
