Alternatively referred to as a cell, cellular, and cellular phone, a cell phone (sometimes abbreviated as cp) is a mobile or portable phone. It enables a user to communicate almost anywhere in the world. The cell phone was invented by Dr. Martin Cooper, along with his team of developers at Motorola. The first cell phone weighed 2.4-pounds and was 9-inches long. Dr. Cooper also made the first cell phone call at Motorola on April 3, 1973.
As you can see in the picture of the Nokia 6010 cell phone to the right, modern cell phones have changed drastically from the original cell phones (aka bricks). New cell phones are much lighter than the old brick cell phones, much smaller, and have LCD screens (often a color LCD) to display contacts, pictures, ringtones, apps, games, etc.
